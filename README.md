# SyncKick

_SyncKick is a tool to listen to podcasts and audio in ‚Äòsync‚Äô with your friends and enable real conversations around the content you love._

Listening to content is an often lonely pursuit where you just listen to things in your own world disconnected from your friends. It is hard to talk to people about things when they listen to something you listened to three months later (or never). SyncKick allows users to listen to audio (podcasts, books and music) in sync and encourage conversation with real people and be less lonely.

Users can listen at the exact same time or catch up on things the other has listened to and stay in sync. Kicking awesome üòù
